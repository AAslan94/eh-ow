## üß© Overview

The network architecture comprises two primary node types:

- **Coordinator Nodes**
  - Utilize **Visible Light Communication (VLC)** for data transmission.  
  - Equipped with a **photodiode (PD)** for data reception.  

- **Sensor Nodes**
  - Transmit data using **Infrared (IR)** signals.  
  - Equipped with **photovoltaic (PV) panels** for both **data reception** and **energy harvesting**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Supports inclusion of **natural and artificial light sources** in the simulation environment.  
- Models **PV panels** based on standard **mono-crystalline photovoltaic parameters**, with harvesting capacity determined by **panel size** and **operating voltage**.  
- Includes an **optimization framework** to determine:
  - The **minimum required PV panel area**.  
  - The **near-optimal panel orientation** for maximum energy harvesting efficiency.
